# Using FishEar's JARs in your project #

<div><b>Direct using of JARs</b> in project <b>is deprecated</b> method. We preffer using of some dependency management tool </div>
based on [Maven repositories](http://mvnrepository.com/) ([Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) itself, [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/), ...), as is described on **[UsingFishear](UsingFishear.md)** page.

### Why don't use JARs directly ###
  * all the documentation is writted for using Maven
  * The JARs are updated occasionaly only, usually with(a large) delay
  * you need solve all dependencies by yourself and put proper version of JARs to yout classpath
  * <div>JARs are provided without garance.</div> Please **DO NOT report any issues** when you use JARs in your project.

If you yet want to use JARs directly, you can download them from [this page](http://code.google.com/p/fishear/downloads/).
