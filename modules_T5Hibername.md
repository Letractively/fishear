## Hibernate Tapestry5 DAO ##

Small module which couples together the fishear's [Hibernate DAO](modules_Hibernate.md) with Tapestry 5.

DAO implementation integrated with Tapestry 5 Hibernate Seesion Manager.

With this module your project will share hibernate session with Tapestry 5 application.


## Module Installation ##

Installation is very simple - the modules JAR only puts to the classpath, or MAVEN dependency adds to the project. That's all.

Module registers itself automatically to Tapestry5 application and is used by [core DAO as default data source](modules_Data.md).
