# Hibernat Dao Module #

Small module which couples together the fishear's [Hibernate DAO](hiberdao.md) with Tapestry 5.

## Module Installation ##

Installation is very simple - the modules JAR only puts to the classpath, or MAVEN dependency adds to the project. That's all.

Module registers itself automatically to Tapestry5 application and is used by [core DAO](gdao.md).
