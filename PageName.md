# Objectives #
  * to simplify of repeated tasks during developing of small to middle-size projects
  * to provide standard set of tools (libraries, methods) to standardize developing tasks
  * to speed up developing

# Why yet another framework ? #
Because
  * we have started creating it a few years ago
  * we use it in several projects and production applications
  * it is quite simply to use
  * it is functional and used in some production applications
  * We think it can be useful for more people than for us
