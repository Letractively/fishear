# FishEar #

<div><font color='#A0A0A0' size='1'>Although the POJO vogue governs over JAVA world today, I thing we should use "horse sense" for all things, including software developement. Some reasonable inheritance could bring application simplification and save lot of work, while application can stay understandable without special knowledges. That is the reason why we (couple of years ago) introduced this set of libraries and why we use them till now. Because I think it can be useful for someone else, I released it as opensource project.</font>

FishEar is set of Java libraries to simplify mainly (but not only) web application development. It is focused to Tapestry 5 and database access. !Each parts may be used independently or in collaboration with other parts. For example <a href='modules_Data.md'>database modules</a> may be used without <a href='modules_T5.md'>Tapestry modules</a>, <a href='modules_T5.md'>Tapestry modules</a> may be used without <a href='modules_Data.md'>Database modules</a>, or may be used all together.<br>
