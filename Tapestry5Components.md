# Tapestry 5 components and addons #

There is several components and add-ons

## Bingings ##

### "`msg:`" binding prefix ###
it may be used in `${msg:SOMETHING}`. Unlike `message:` prefix, the `msg:` searches in component resources and all parent components up to page. Also it is able to replace variables directly in templat, for example `${msg:my-%s-label,prop:labelOrder}`
Also "msg" binding may contain parameters (after comma), that are replaced during rendering. Of course, comma cannot be part of the message code. Suppose fragment in Java class
```

@property
String myName = "Jan Bay"```

and use in template
```

${msg:my-name-is-label,prop:myName}```

in property file:
```

my-name-is-label=My Name is %s```

So result in the rendered page will be
```

My Name is Jan Bay```


## Components ##
  * `<t:fe.select ... >` that can directly manipulate with [a service](AbstractService.md) (can be created directly by entity data using a service)
  * `<t:fe.combobox ... >` that is similar to the `<fe.select ...>`, but more generic
  * `<t:fe.label for="...">` the label that is generated by the component
  * `<t:fe.checkboxOut ... >` displaye a checkbox outside forms

## Mixins ##
  * `fe/confirm`
  * `fe/confirmDelete`
